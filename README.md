# Student Manager
A project from 2019 for Data Structures and Algorithms. This project is a BST that reads commands from command line and performs actions on a database.
Competed over a week in September 2019 with the help of a partner.

BinarySearchTree is a basic BST, while Section represents a class section and contains a BST to hold students. Students themselves are represented by the Student class and contain data themselves.
